# Game Features:
In Tic-Tac-Toe (Noughts & Crosses), 2 players take turns to put down an X or an O on a 3 x 3 grid. A player wins by placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line. If no player is successful in making a line, the game is a draw.

Player's turn and player's scores are tracked. A restart button is used to clear the game board.
